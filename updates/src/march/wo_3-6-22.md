I've been working on adding the three individual years together into a single set of plots to compare against the results of training on all three years combined from the beginning (which I refer to as "Run 2"). So far there's two issues. I can't save the counts for the backgrounds/signals in the individual year plots or add them together. There might be a way to work around this and pull the numbers from the legends and add them and then use the sums in a new legend, or loop over each bin in the histogram and add the counts. The latter option might be harder since it's a <span style="color:royalblue">THStack</span> not just a single histogram. The other issue is that the errors on the histogram's don't add because they're not histograms, they're <span style="color:royalblue;">TGraphAymmErrors</span>. I think I'll have to take the final histogram stack that gets saved and use that to create the new AsymmErrors (similar to how I create the errors in the first place).

The other thing I've been working on is expanding the uncertainties on the histograms.

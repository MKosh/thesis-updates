# Full run 2 with 'year' as a variable
I added the year as a variable and reran the training for the datasets where the data was combined pre-training (maybe I should call that 'pre-combined' and the other set 'post-combined'? that sounds like a better distinction).
- Here are the plots after the optimal cuts

| BDT cut | [Trained in SR](img/3-30-22/Run2_sr_BDT_year_19-16.pdf) | [Trained in full WV boosted region](img/3-30-22/Run2_wv_boosted_BDT_year_18-10.pdf) |
|---|---|---|
| **DNN cut** | [**Trained in SR**](img/3-30-22/Run2_sr_DNN_year_19-18.pdf) | [**Trained in full WV boosted region**](img/3-30-22/Run2_wv_boosted_DNN_year_18-43.pdf) |

- Compared to the plots from last week ('non-summed' or pre-combined BDT cut plots) There's about 30-40 fewer events, but no major differences. There's closer to 100 more events than in the post-combined (summed) plots from last week. The year was at the bottom of the variable rankings for both sets of training. So it seems like the increased number of training events allowed the model to select more likely-events, and accounting for the year brought the event counts around a third of the way back down.
